# TTE_INSIGHTING
This repository contains a Python implementation of Target Trial Emulation (TTE), an epidemiological framework for reducing biases in observational studies, enhanced with KMeans clustering to identify patient subgroups. TTE.ipynb replicates the original R-based TTE methodology from [Target Trial Emulation in R by Alan Yang](https://rpubs.com/alanyang0924/TTE) using Python/Jupyter Notebook, then introduces a novel integration of clustering to analyze heterogeneous treatment effects across data-driven patient clusters in TTE-v2.ipynb. Key deliverables include reproducible workflows for causal inference, visualization of cluster-specific survival outcomes, and insights on how clustering improves confounding adjustment and effect estimation.
